# Azure Pipeline YAML File Explanation

This Azure Pipeline is designed to build and test ASP.NET Core projects that target the full .NET Framework. It also restores NuGet packages, publishes the build artifacts, and packages the output for deployment.

## Pipeline Explanation

### Trigger
```yaml
trigger:
- main
```
- The pipeline triggers automatically on any changes pushed to the `main` branch.

### Pool
```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'
```
- The pipeline runs on the latest Windows-based VM image provided by Azure DevOps.

### Variables
```yaml
variables:
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildPlatform: 'Any CPU'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
```
- `solution`: A wildcard pattern to identify the solution file (`.sln`) in the repository.
- `buildPlatform`: Specifies the platform to target (e.g., "Any CPU").
- `buildConfiguration`: Sets the build configuration to "Release".

### Steps

1. **Install NuGet Tool**
```yaml
- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1
```
- Ensures that the latest version of NuGet is available on the agent.

2. **Restore NuGet Packages**
```yaml
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    restoreSolution: '$(solution)'
```
- Restores NuGet packages for the solution specified in the `solution` variable.

3. **Build the Project**
```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: Build
  inputs:
    command: build
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
```
- Builds all `.csproj` files in the repository using the `Release` configuration.

4. **Publish the Project**
```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True
```
- Publishes the build output to the `Artifact Staging Directory`.
- The `zipAfterPublish` option compresses the output files into a ZIP archive.

5. **Publish Build Artifacts**
```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)' 
    artifactName: 'sqlapp-secure-artifact'
```
- Publishes the contents of the `Artifact Staging Directory` as a pipeline artifact named `sqlapp-secure-artifact`, which can be used in subsequent stages like release or deployment.
